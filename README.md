### 🚀 About Me

I'm a Senior Software Developer with 7.5+ years of experience building high-scale backend systems using Node.js, NestJS, and AWS. My expertise includes designing microservices, integrating Kafka, and delivering GraphQL-first APIs using Hasura and Apollo. I've worked across fintech, e-commerce, and real estate platforms and have a strong focus on clean code, modular architecture, and performance tuning.

I love building tools that solve real problems — most recently, a WhatsApp Lead Capture Tool integrated with Hasura and Kafka.
